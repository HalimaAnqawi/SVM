### Face Recognition using SVM

This is a Face Recognition Demo using Support Vector Machines. Interactive features and widgets were created using the great tool [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). It is an open-source framework, free, Python-based and easy to use tool to build and deploy data-driven and machine learning applications. 

The demo provides three key features 

* It loads the testing set, view it and show you if the predictions of the SVM model was correct or not as can be seen below
